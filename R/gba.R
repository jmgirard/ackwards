# Step 1: Extract factor solution with j factors (j in 1 to m)

# Step 2: Save the factor scores (estimates) from solution j

# Step 3: Evaluate m (when to stop) based on when a factor has no indicator
#         as its highest loading

# Step 4: Correlate the factor scores (estimates) from solutions j and j+1

# Step 5: Plot all factors and add all paths from j to j+1 that exceeded a
#         threshold (default = +- 0.3), |r| > 0.9 as solid lines and
#         .3 <= |r| <= .9 as dashed lines
