Package name: **`ackwards`** (distinctive, searchable, nods to the
method’s own name; avoids colliding with
[`psych::bassAckward()`](https://rdrr.io/pkg/psych/man/bassAckward.html)).
Confirm with `available::available("ackwards")` before committing. Main
call:
[`ackwards::ackwards()`](https://jmgirard.github.io/ackwards/reference/ackwards.md).

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 1. Purpose

Implement Goldberg’s (2006) bass-ackwards method and its modern
descendants: extract a series of factor/component solutions from 1 to
`k`, then characterize the hierarchy by the correlations between
factor/component scores at adjacent (and, for extensions, all) levels.
The package provides multiple extraction engines, principled tooling for
choosing `k`, sign/lineage-aware naming, tidy outputs, and attractive
console + graphical reporting.

## 2. Scope & positioning

**Prior art.**
[`psych::bassAckward()`](https://rdrr.io/pkg/psych/man/bassAckward.html)
(Revelle) already implements the core loop for PCA and EFA with rotation
and `tenBerge` scores. We do **not** reimplement factor extraction
numerics; we wrap established engines and add what `psych` does not.

**Our contribution.** - A first-class **ESEM engine** (lavaan), bringing
the Mplus psychopathology/HiTOP workflow into R — per-level fit indices
and SEs, ordinal/Likert support — which
[`psych::bassAckward`](https://rdrr.io/pkg/psych/man/bassAckward.html)
does not provide. (Kim & Eaton 2015; Forbush et al. 2024 are the
reference workflows.) - Proper **ordinal/Likert handling** (polychoric
basis, ordinal estimators). - The **Forbes (2023) extended method**
(redundancy + artifact pruning via the standalone
[`prune()`](https://jmgirard.github.io/ackwards/reference/prune.md)
verb, all-levels correlations). - A clean, tidy, serializable **result
object** with `print`/`summary`/`tidy`/`glance`/`autoplot`. - A
**lineage-aligned layered diagram** rather than a misleading tree.

**Honesty caveat to state in docs and `print`.** A bass-ackwards result
is a *series of linked solutions*, not a fitted hierarchical model. The
“hierarchy” is descriptive/emergent (edges are score correlations), not
a higher-order SEM. `psych`’s own docs make this point; we should too.

## 3. Design philosophy & priorities

These are the project’s standing priorities (owner-stated) and the
recommended stance on each.

- **Manageable dependencies.** `psych` is in `Imports` (M21 — it is the
  engine substrate for the default PCA/EFA paths; requiring an install
  prompt for the default engine contradicted this principle). Everything
  else heavy or engine-specific remains in `Suggests` behind
  [`rlang::check_installed()`](https://rlang.r-lib.org/reference/is_installed.html)
  guards. Installing the package must not pull in the SEM or plotting
  stacks. `GPArotation` was removed (M21 — varimax routes through
  [`stats::varimax`](https://rdrr.io/r/stats/varimax.html)). (See §12.)
- **Best practices.** testthat 3e, roxygen2, pkgdown, CI (`R CMD check`,
  lintr/styler), semantic versioning, snapshot tests against `psych` for
  the PCA path, a vignette reproducing a published structure.
- **Attractive outputs.** [cli](https://cli.r-lib.org) for all console
  output (`print`, `summary`, progress, warnings);
  [ggraph](https://ggraph.data-imaginist.com)/[ggplot2](https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org)
  for diagrams. Visuals and pretty printing are a feature, not an
  afterthought.
- **Efficiency / Rcpp.** *Recommendation: do not reach for Rcpp
  initially.* The heavy compute (eigen/ML/WLSMV, polychoric estimation)
  already lives in compiled code inside lavaan/psych/BLAS. The
  bass-ackwards-specific work is small matrix products (`W'RW`, where
  items `p` is modest and factors `k` is small) and small
  assignment/pruning steps — none are bottlenecks. The realistic
  hotspots are (a) **many bootstrap/permutation resamples** for
  stability/CIs, and (b) the **ESEM engine at large p**, where lavaan
  re-deriving the polychoric matrix + asymptotic weight matrix (NACOV)
  at every level dominates. Both are addressed with reuse +
  [future](https://future.futureverse.org) parallelism rather than Rcpp:
  M26 computes the ESEM sample statistics once (data-derived,
  level-independent) and reuses them via `slotSampleStats=`, then
  dispatches the independent per-level fits through `future.apply`
  (opt-in via
  [`future::plan()`](https://future.futureverse.org/reference/plan.html);
  serial fallback). Only consider Rcpp if profiling proves a remaining
  C-level bottleneck. Measure before optimizing.
- **Safe, reproducible, and *loud* defaults.** (See §9.) The guiding
  rule: when the package makes a consequential automatic choice
  (correlation basis, `k`, rotation), it **announces it via cli** so the
  user who never reads an argument still sees what happened.

## 4. Engines

Three engines, all first-class, behind one user-facing function
([`ackwards()`](https://jmgirard.github.io/ackwards/reference/ackwards.md))
that dispatches. Rotation is a single fixed choice across all engines:
**varimax** (orthogonal; the `T'=T^-1` property enables the closed-form
W’RW algebra). Oblique rotation is out of scope — see §9 and §14.1.

| Engine | Extraction | Typical use | Notes |
|----|----|----|----|
| `"pca"` | principal components | original Goldberg; Forbes extension | fastest, no Heywood, never fails to converge; Waller algebra exact |
| `"efa"` | exploratory factor analysis | factor-model rationale, continuous data | [`psych::fa`](https://rdrr.io/pkg/psych/man/fa.html) / [`stats::factanal`](https://rdrr.io/r/stats/factanal.html) style |
| `"esem"` | EFA estimated in SEM framework (lavaan) | clinical/HiTOP workflow, ordinal data, downstream SEM linking | per-level fit + SEs; can fail to converge at deeper levels |

**Engine interface (contract).** Every engine, for each level
`k = 1..K`, returns a standardized per-level object:

``` r
level <- list(
  k           = <int>,
  loadings    = <p x k matrix>,       # pattern matrix, item x factor
  loadings_se = <p x k matrix | NULL>,# rotation-aware SEs; NULL for PCA/EFA; populated by ESEM
  variance    = <named numeric>,      # per-factor + cumulative variance explained
  fit         = <named numeric>,      # scalar fit indices / eigenvalues (chi, df, CFI, TLI,
                                      # RMSEA, SRMR for ESEM; eigenvalues for PCA)
  converged   = <logical>,            # FALSE allowed; never fatal (see §13)
  factor_cor  = <k x k matrix>,       # within-level factor correlations (I for orthogonal)
  labels      = <character[k]>,       # default m{k}f{j}; user-overridable
  scoring     = <scoring descriptor>  # see §5
)
```

A level that fails to converge is **recorded, warned about, and
skipped**, never thrown. The hierarchy is built up to the deepest
converged level.

## 5. Scoring descriptor + `compute_edges()` (the centerpiece)

The between-level edges are computed through **one shared code path**
that uses exact algebra when it can and falls back to materialized
scores when it must. This unifies result semantics across engines
without forcing the expensive computation everywhere.

### 5.1 Why the algebra generalizes

For any scoring scheme where scores are a **linear** map of the
standardized observed variables, `S = Z W`, the between-level score
correlations are exactly:

    cor(S_a, S_b) = D_a^{-1/2} (W_a' R W_b) D_b^{-1/2}
               where  R   = input correlation matrix (pearson or polychoric)
                      D_x = diag(W_x' R W_x)   # score variances; NOT assumed 1

No scores need to be materialized — only `R` and the weight matrices.
Waller (2007) derived this for orthogonal components, but the identity
holds for **any linear `W`**, which includes regression (Thurstone,
`W = R^{-1} Λ`), Bartlett, and tenBerge scores. So the standard PCA
*and* EFA/ESEM (regression-scored) paths are all algebra-eligible.

**Standardization is the trap.** Component/factor scores are not
unit-variance in general (Bartlett and oblique scores especially).
Always divide by the real score SDs from `sqrt(diag(W'RW))`. Assuming
unit variance silently corrupts the correlations.

### 5.2 Scoring descriptor (returned per level by each engine)

``` r

scoring <- list(
  linear    = TRUE,                # are scores a fixed linear map S = Z W?
  method    = "tenBerge",          # "components" | "regression" | "bartlett" | "tenBerge" | "EAP" | ...
  basis     = "pearson",           # "pearson" | "polychoric" | "spearman"
  weights   = W,                   # p x k score-coefficient matrix; NULL if !linear
  score_var = v                    # length-k vector = diag(W'RW); NULL if !linear
)
```

### 5.3 `compute_edges()` contract

``` r
compute_edges(levels, R,
              edge_method = c("auto", "algebra", "scores"),
              pairs  = c("adjacent", "all"),   # "all" for Forbes extension
              data   = NULL,
              align  = TRUE,
              use    = "pairwise") {

  for (each pair (a, b) in chosen pairs) {

    algebra_ok <- levels[[a]]$scoring$linear &&
                  levels[[b]]$scoring$linear && !is.null(R)

    if (edge_method == "algebra" || (edge_method == "auto" && algebra_ok)) {
      Wa <- levels[[a]]$scoring$weights
      Wb <- levels[[b]]$scoring$weights
      C  <- crossprod(Wa, R %*% Wb)                       # W_a' R W_b
      sa <- sqrt(diag(crossprod(Wa, R %*% Wa)))           # score SDs
      sb <- sqrt(diag(crossprod(Wb, R %*% Wb)))
      E  <- sweep(sweep(C, 1, sa, "/"), 2, sb, "/")       # standardize
    } else {
      stopifnot(!is.null(data))                           # nonlinear/EAP or edge_method="scores"
      Sa <- score(levels[[a]], data); Sb <- score(levels[[b]], data)
      E  <- cor(Sa, Sb, use = use)
    }

    if (align) E <- align_signs(E, lineage)               # see §7
    edges[[pair]] <- E
  }
  # return: list of (k_a x k_b) matrices  +  tidy edge tibble (from, to, r, is_primary, above_cut)
}
```

**Two situations force the `scores` route:** 1. **Nonlinear scoring** —
EAP/MAP/ML scores from a *categorical/ordinal* ESEM. (If the ordinal
ESEM instead uses regression scores off polychoric loadings, it stays
linear → algebra on the polychoric `R`.) 2. **User wants empirical,
sample-realized correlations** (including FIML/missing-data realities)
rather than the model-implied quantity. Under missingness these differ;
document which one “the edge” represents (default: model-consistent /
algebra where eligible).

### 5.4 Built-in cross-check (correctness oracle)

For a linear engine, algebra and materialized-scores must agree within
sampling error. Keep the `scores` route available even where `algebra`
is the default, and add a test asserting
`max(abs(E_algebra - E_scores)) < tol` on a known dataset. This catches
weight-convention, standardization, sign, and column-ordering bugs
cheaply.

## 6. Result object (S3) & storage rule

S3, not R6/S4 — matches `psych`/`lavaan`/broom conventions and
serializes cleanly.

``` r
structure(list(
  call, engine, rotation, cor, n_obs, k_max, seed, pkg_version,
  levels  = <list indexed by k; each is the §4 level object>,
  edges   = <list of adjacent (and optionally all-pairs) correlation matrices
             + tidy edge tibble>,
  lineage = <primary-parent matching: ordering + sign anchors; kept SEPARATE from IDs>,
  scores  = NULL,        # opt-in (large n; privacy); accessor recomputes on demand
  fits    = NULL,        # opt-in raw engine objects (keep_fits = TRUE)
  r       = <p x p input correlation matrix>,   # cheap; kept so scores/edges recomputable
  data    = NULL,        # opt-in raw data
  meta    = <suggest_k output, timestamps, convergence summary, chosen defaults,
             input_type = "data"|"cor_matrix">,
  prune   = NULL         # Forbes extension: node flags + chain table + phi table;
                         # populated by prune(x, ...) -- a standalone verb piped off
                         # ackwards(), not an ackwards() argument (M34; see s.14)
), class = "ackwards")
```

**Storage rule.** *Light tidy core always; heavy artifacts opt-in.* -
**Always:** loadings, variance, fit/convergence, weight matrices,
within-level correlations, edges, lineage, the `p x p` input `R`, meta.
This is enough for diagram + interpretation and is small and
shareable. - **Opt-in:** factor `scores` (O(n × Σk); also a
privacy/sharing liability), raw `fits` (lavaan fits can be large), raw
`data`. Defaults: `scores = FALSE`, `keep_fits = FALSE`, keep
`R = TRUE`.

This directly answers the “giant list of fitted models vs. just
loadings/scores/correlations” question: neither — a structured light
core, with the heavy bits nullable and recomputable.

## 7. Naming & sign conventions

- **IDs:** models numbered by factor count (`m1`…`mK`); factors within a
  model `m{k}f{j}`.
- **Deterministic within-level order = primary-parent (recursive),
  variance tiebreak.** Sort factors within a level by (primary parent’s
  position in the level above, then descending variance). The single top
  factor and any ties fall back to variance. This places each child
  under its parent so splits read cleanly; the `f{j}` ID order follows
  this layout order so tables and plots agree. Limitation: ordering
  reduces but can’t eliminate crossings (a child with a strong
  *secondary* parent elsewhere still throws a crossing edge); the
  layout’s barycenter step (§11) refines x-position continuously beyond
  the discrete order.
- **Lineage lives in `edges`/`lineage`, never in the ID.** A child can
  have multiple strong parents (the point of the method), so don’t
  encode parentage into `m{k}f{j}` — it breaks when the structure isn’t
  a clean tree.
- **Matching:** assign each factor its primary parent via **greedy
  per-column argmax** on `|r|` (i.e. `apply(abs(E), 2, which.max)`).
  Multiple children sharing the same parent is normal and expected —
  adjacent levels always have n_b = n_a + 1 (level k has k factors vs
  k−1 above), so by pigeonhole at least two children share a parent. A
  bijection (LSAP/Hungarian) is therefore ill-posed and was removed.
  Tucker’s φ serves as a supplementary congruence criterion for
  `redundancy_phi` filtering (Forbes extension, §14.19) but is not used
  for matching itself.
- **Sign alignment — anchor to the primary parent, NOT “all positive.”**
  Sign is one DoF per factor; you cannot make every cross-level
  correlation positive. Rule: anchor `m1f1` to a defined orientation
  (positive sum of loadings, or a substantive marker item), then orient
  each factor so its correlation with its **primary parent** is
  positive, propagating top-down. Document that non-primary edges may
  legitimately be negative. *Implementation note (M35):* “propagating
  top-down” means each child’s flip is chosen against the parent’s
  **already-aligned** sign, not the parent’s raw orientation — otherwise
  a flipped parent leaves its own primary edge displaying negative. So
  every primary-parent edge is non-negative; only secondary edges may be
  red.

## 8. Suggesting k

[`suggest_k()`](https://jmgirard.github.io/ackwards/reference/suggest_k.md)
returns **several complementary criteria and a consensus range**, never
a single number. The five criteria implemented (M12):

| Criterion | Source | Function | Notes |
|----|----|----|----|
| **PA-PC** | Horn (1965), PC basis | `psych::fa.parallel(fa = "both")` | Tends to overextract; use as upper bound |
| **PA-FA** | Horn (1965), FA basis | same call | More conservative; model-consistent for EFA/ESEM |
| **MAP** | Velicer (1976) | [`psych::vss()`](https://rdrr.io/pkg/psych/man/VSS.html) | Minimise average squared partial; usually conservative |
| **VSS-1/VSS-2** | Revelle & Rocklin (1979) | same call (already returned) | Maximise very-simple-structure fit at complexities 1 and 2 |
| **CD** | Ruscio & Roche (2012) | [`EFAtools::CD()`](https://rdrr.io/pkg/EFAtools/man/CD.html) (optional) | Resamples raw data; among top performers in simulation; skipped gracefully when `EFAtools` absent. M21: `cd_rmse = colMeans(RMSE_eigenvalues)` stored in object; dedicated 4th panel in [`autoplot.suggest_k()`](https://jmgirard.github.io/ackwards/reference/autoplot.suggest_k.md) (2×2 grid when CD present; 3-panel single column otherwise). |

**Selective computation (M25).** A `criteria` argument
(`rlang::arg_match(multiple = TRUE)`, default all five) lets callers
request any subset of `c("pa_pc", "pa_fa", "map", "vss", "cd")`.
Skipping is a real compute saving, not output filtering: `pa_pc`/`pa_fa`
share one `fa.parallel(fa = "both")` call (both or neither run) and
`map`/`vss` share one `vss()` call, so e.g. `criteria = "map"` avoids
the PA simulation entirely; `vss` toggles VSS-1+VSS-2 as a unit.
Non-requested `k_*` fields are `NA`; the `criteria` data frame keeps a
stable schema (NA-filled non-run columns); the object records
`criteria_requested`.
[`print()`](https://rdrr.io/r/base/print.html)/[`autoplot()`](https://jmgirard.github.io/ackwards/reference/autoplot.md)
render only requested criteria and the consensus range is computed from
requested criteria only.

Empirical Kaiser Criterion (EKC) and EGA ([EGAnet](https://r-ega.net))
are **out of scope** — additional deps without sufficient incremental
benefit over the five criteria above. Note:
[`suggest_k()`](https://jmgirard.github.io/ackwards/reference/suggest_k.md)
accepts `cor = "pearson"` (default) or `"spearman"` only; `"polychoric"`
is not supported (PA and VSS do not have a polychoric
eigen-decomposition path). Users analysing ordinal data should run
[`suggest_k()`](https://jmgirard.github.io/ackwards/reference/suggest_k.md)
on the Pearson matrix and then switch to `cor = "polychoric"` in
[`ackwards()`](https://jmgirard.github.io/ackwards/reference/ackwards.md).
Report that `k` is a maximum *depth*; users often deliberately set it a
level or two past the consensus to watch factors fragment. Note the
overextraction/non-replicability caution (Forbes 2023). Add a `seed`
argument for reproducibility of the **CD step only** —
[`psych::fa.parallel()`](https://rdrr.io/pkg/psych/man/fa.parallel.html)
does not respond reliably to
[`set.seed()`](https://rdrr.io/r/base/Random.html), so PA simulation
results will vary across calls regardless of `seed`. See
[`vignette("ackwards-suggest-k")`](https://jmgirard.github.io/ackwards/articles/ackwards-suggest-k.md)
for a narrative/educational treatment of all five criteria including
pros/cons, bias direction, and engine-to-criterion pairing (M14).

## 9. Defaults (high-stakes — users will not override these)

Principle: **safe, robust, reproducible, and self-disclosing.** Every
consequential auto-choice is announced via cli and documented in roxygen
with its rationale.

| Decision | Default | Rationale |
|----|----|----|
| `engine` | `"pca"` | original method; fastest; never fails to converge; algebra-exact. Docs steer to `efa`/`esem` when a measurement-model rationale exists. |
| `rotation` | **varimax — the only supported rotation; not a user argument** | **Only orthogonal rotation produces interpretable between-level factor score correlations** in the bass-ackwards method (Goldberg 2006; Kim & Eaton 2015): T’T = I so T’ = T^-1, enabling closed-form W’RW algebra (Waller 2007) without materialising scores. CF(κ = 1/p) ≡ varimax (Crawford & Ferguson 1970; Browne 2001) — no reference paper varies κ. Oblique rotation is out of scope (resolved 2026-06, M13): it confounds the cross-level signal that is the method’s whole point. `rotation` was removed as a user argument in M13 (varimax hardcoded internally). |
| `estimator` (ESEM only) | **`"WLSMV"`** for `cor = "polychoric"`; `"ML"` otherwise | WLSMV (mean-and-variance-adjusted WLS) is the standard limited-information ordinal estimator (matches Kim & Eaton 2015; Forbush et al. 2024); gives correct fit indices for categorical indicators without full-information ML cost. |
| `cor` (basis) | **`"pearson"`** (matches `psych`/`lavaan`); ordinal opt-in via `cor = "polychoric"` | No silent basis-switching (it can change the structure and break comparison to published work). Instead, **detect likely-ordinal columns and emit a suppressible cli warning** pointing to the polychoric option — loud *advice*, not silent action. |
| scores (method) | **`"tenBerge"`** on the active basis (pearson or polychoric) for factor engines; `"components"` for PCA; `"EAP"` opt-in only | tenBerge preserves factor correlations (the property bass-ackwards cares about) and stays linear → algebra-eligible. For ordinal ESEM, tenBerge-on-polychoric gives the clean model-implied edge; EAP’s shrinkage attenuates cross-level correlations, so it’s an opt-in (triggers the scores route + raw-data requirement), not the default. |
| `edge_method` | `"auto"` | algebra when linear, scores otherwise. |
| `pairs` ([`ackwards()`](https://jmgirard.github.io/ackwards/reference/ackwards.md)) | `"adjacent"` | classic Goldberg; `"all"` reveals skip-level correlations for inspection/plotting. Since M34, [`prune()`](https://jmgirard.github.io/ackwards/reference/prune.md) recomputes its own all-pairs edges on demand regardless of this setting — pruning no longer requires (or auto-upgrades) `pairs = "all"` here. |
| [`prune()`](https://jmgirard.github.io/ackwards/reference/prune.md) `rules` (standalone verb, M34 — not an [`ackwards()`](https://jmgirard.github.io/ackwards/reference/ackwards.md) argument) | **`"none"`** | pruning is an interpretive choice with thresholds, kept as a separate, cheap, re-runnable step piped off an already-extracted object (`ackwards(...) |> prune(...)`) so new thresholds never require re-extraction. Turning it on silently would change results — opt-in with documented thresholds ( |
| `redundancy_phi` ([`prune()`](https://jmgirard.github.io/ackwards/reference/prune.md) argument, M34) | **`NULL` (auto)** — PCA → no φ filter (W′RW algebra is exact; `|r|` alone is sufficient); EFA/ESEM → `0.95` (Lorenzo-Seva & ten Berge 2006; factor-score indeterminacy off-PCA makes `|r|`-only liberal; φ adds a congruence guard). Explicit number overrides on any engine. `NA` is the opt-out (no φ filter regardless of engine). Announces auto-resolve via cli (Invariant 6). **Added M25**; moved from an [`ackwards()`](https://jmgirard.github.io/ackwards/reference/ackwards.md) argument to a [`prune()`](https://jmgirard.github.io/ackwards/reference/prune.md) argument in M34. |  |
| sign `align_signs` | `TRUE` | unaligned signs make output unreadable. |
| `keep_fits` / `keep_scores` | `FALSE` / `FALSE` | memory + privacy. |
| `k_max` | required | force a deliberate choice; don’t silently pick. |
| `seed` | `NULL` but captured | stochastic engines (rotation starts, ML) need reproducibility; encourage setting. |
| `missing` | **`"pairwise"`** | preserves existing behaviour (pairwise-complete correlations); warns when NAs present. `"listwise"` gives fully consistent N across fit and edges (reduces to complete cases pre-fit). `"fiml"` (ESEM ML/MLR only) uses Full Information ML and derives edge R from lavaan’s FIML saturated model. FIML errors for PCA, EFA, and WLSMV/ULSMV. Added M16; **see §14 “ESEM ML/MLR pairwise” limitation entry** (the ML/MLR fit-vs-edges inconsistency under missingness is resolved for `"listwise"` and `"fiml"`; `"pairwise"` retains the existing minor inconsistency and now warns). Ignored (with a warning) when a correlation matrix is supplied — added M22. |
| `n_obs` | `NULL` (new M22) | required for `engine = "efa"` when a correlation matrix is supplied (psych needs N for chi-square/RMSEA); optional for `"pca"` (stored as `NA_integer_`). Ignored (with a warning) when raw data are supplied (N comes from `nrow(data)`). |

### Documentation standard (owner priority)

- Every default above is documented in roxygen with **why**, not just
  **what**.
- An `@details` section explains the algebra-vs-scores edge computation
  in plain language, and when a user would prefer
  `edge_method = "scores"`.
- Runnable `@examples` for each exported function; a vignette reproduces
  a published structure (e.g., a
  [`psych::bfi`](https://rdrr.io/pkg/psych/man/bfi.html) bass-ackwards)
  end to end.
- `@seealso` cross-links engines,
  [`suggest_k()`](https://jmgirard.github.io/ackwards/reference/suggest_k.md),
  and the plotting/printing methods.

## 10. Console & tidy representations

- **`print.ackwards`** — compact cli “card”: call, engine, rotation, cor
  basis, `n`, level range, per-level convergence, deepest usable level,
  count of edges above the show-cut. No matrix dumps. States the “series
  of linked solutions, not a fitted hierarchy” caveat once.
- **`summary.ackwards`** — per-level variance explained and fit indices
  (ESEM); a readable lineage list (`m1f1 → m2f1, m2f2 → …`); flagged
  redundant/artifact components when the object has been pruned via
  [`prune()`](https://jmgirard.github.io/ackwards/reference/prune.md).
- **`top_items(x, level, cut, n, sort)`** (M18) — per-factor
  salient-item listing, filtered to `|loading| >= cut` and sorted
  descending. Returns a `top_items` S3 object with a grouped cli print
  method. Loadings reflect primary-parent sign alignment (Inv. 4). The
  `$data` field is a subset of the `tidy(what = "loadings")` table.
- **broom-style tidiers:**
  - `tidy(x, what = "edges")` *(default)* — one row per directed edge
    `(from m_k f_i, to m_{k+1} f_j, r, is_primary, above_cut)`. This is
    the graph edge list and the primary plotting input.
  - `tidy(x, what = "loadings")` — long format
    `(level, factor, item, loading)`, sign-aligned; feeds loading
    heatmaps.
  - `tidy(x, what = "variance")` — per-factor variance by level:
    `(level, factor, proportion, cumulative)`, both on a 0-1 scale (M32;
    matches the engine’s internal representation and broom/psych
    convention — percent formatting is a display concern for
    `print`/`summary`, not a
    [`tidy()`](https://generics.r-lib.org/reference/tidy.html) concern).
  - `tidy(x, what = "fit")` — per-level fit statistic:
    `(level, statistic, value)` (M32: column renamed from `index`, which
    read like a row position rather than a fit-statistic name — it holds
    fit-index names for EFA/ESEM and eigenvalue positions for PCA).
    `format = "wide"` pivots to one row per level. No pass/fail
    `cutoffs=`/`meets` output (removed M32) — conventional Hu &
    Bentler (1999) thresholds are conventional and contested, so
    [`tidy()`](https://generics.r-lib.org/reference/tidy.html) reports
    values only; `autoplot(what = "fit")` and
    [`summary()`](https://rdrr.io/r/base/summary.html) render them as
    reference lines/inline annotations.
  - `glance(x)` — one row of model-level meta (engine, k_max, n, deepest
    converged, cor basis).
  - `as_tibble(x)` → `tidy(x, "edges")`.

## 11. Visualization

Split **layout** (light, core) from **rendering** (optional, Suggests).
This keeps the dependency footprint sane and lets users plot the layout
however they like.

- **`ba_layout(x)` (core, no heavy deps).** Returns tidy nodes
  `(id, level, x, y, label)` and edges. The structure is a **layered
  DAG**, not a tree (multiple parents allowed), so do **not** use a tree
  layout. Compute `y = -level`; compute `x` with a **two-pass barycenter
  algorithm** (Sugiyama-style crossing reduction):
  1.  **Top-down pass** – determines left-to-right *order* at each
      level. Each factor’s rank is the \|r\|-weighted mean of its
      parents’ ranks, grouping siblings that share a parent and
      minimising crossings.
  2.  **Bottom-up pass** – assigns actual x coordinates. The deepest
      level (level k) is evenly spaced; every upper-level factor is
      placed at the **simple mean x of its primary children**: a factor
      with one primary child lands directly above it; a factor with
      multiple primary children lands exactly halfway between them.
      Falls back to \|r\|-weighted mean of all children for factors with
      no primary children. Spreading enforces `min_sep` between adjacent
      nodes only when needed. The level-1 node is shifted to `x = 0`
      after both passes. This produces the “boxes aligned to their
      primary-child structure” look the owner wants.
- **[`autoplot.ackwards()`](https://jmgirard.github.io/ackwards/reference/autoplot.ackwards.md)
  / [`plot()`](https://rdrr.io/r/graphics/plot.default.html) (Suggests:
  ggplot2).** Renders the layered diagram from
  [`ba_layout()`](https://jmgirard.github.io/ackwards/reference/ba_layout.md) +
  the edge tibble. Edge encodings are **user-assignable and always
  legended** (M35): `sign_by` chooses the channel for **sign** (color by
  default; also linetype, both, or none) and `magnitude_by` chooses the
  channel for **\|r\|** (linewidth by default, or none). No aesthetic is
  mapped without a matching legend. (The pre-M35 strong/weak
  `cut_strong` linetype split was retired — it double-encoded magnitude
  and was legend-less.) Nodes labeled `m{k}f{j}`, optionally with
  substantive labels and top-loading items. `direction` toggles vertical
  (default, level 1 at top) vs. horizontal (level 1 at left)
  orientation.
- **Forbes extension rendering (more complex — phase it).** Keep the
  same layout; **annotate** rather than re-layout: fade/strike pruned
  (redundant/artifact) nodes, and allow **skip-level** edges (longer
  curves) since the extension correlates *all* levels, not just
  adjacent. Default to showing only above-cut edges to control clutter.
  Treat as a later milestone; ship the clean adjacent-level Goldberg
  diagram first.
- **`label_template(x, style)` (M18, core, no heavy deps).** Generates
  the named-character-vector scaffold for `autoplot(node_labels=)`.
  Styles: `"id"` (round-trip identity), `"forbes"` (level- letter +
  within-level index), `"blank"` (empty strings). Returns the vector and
  also prints an editable `c(...)` literal for copy-paste. Factor IDs in
  canonical
  [`ba_layout()`](https://jmgirard.github.io/ackwards/reference/ba_layout.md)
  order.

## 12. Dependencies

| Tier | Packages | Purpose |
|----|----|----|
| Imports | `stats`, `utils`, `cli`, `rlang`, `generics`, `psych` | core, console output, guards, tidy/augment/glance generics; PCA/EFA engines + polychoric correlations (M21: moved from Suggests — engine substrate for default path) |
| Suggests — ESEM | `lavaan (>= 0.6-13)` | ESEM engine |
| Suggests — suggest_k | `EFAtools` (optional) | [`EFAtools::CD()`](https://rdrr.io/pkg/EFAtools/man/CD.html) for Comparison Data (skipped gracefully when absent); no `EGAnet`/`paran` dep |
| ~~Suggests — matching~~ | ~~`clue`~~ | ~~Hungarian assignment~~ — removed M5; greedy argmax (§7) requires no dep |
| ~~Suggests — rotations~~ | ~~`GPArotation`~~ | ~~CF-family rotations~~ — removed M21; varimax routes through [`stats::varimax`](https://rdrr.io/r/stats/varimax.html) and GPArotation never loaded on any supported path |
| Suggests — viz | `ggplot2`, `gt` | diagrams (uses `ggplot2` directly, not `ggraph`/`igraph`/`tidygraph`); `gt` for wide comparison tables in vignettes (M24) |
| Suggests — ESEM parallelism | `future.apply`, `future` (optional) | parallel backend for ESEM per-level fits (M26); gated by [`rlang::is_installed()`](https://rlang.r-lib.org/reference/is_installed.html) with a serial `lapply` fallback; users opt in via [`future::plan()`](https://future.futureverse.org/reference/plan.html) (`future` declared because the parallel test calls `plan()` directly) |
| Suggests — infra | `testthat (>= 3.0.0)`, `knitr`, `rmarkdown`, `covr` | testing, vignettes, coverage |

`methods` is **not** imported — no `methods::` usage in the package.
`ggraph`, `igraph`, `tidygraph`, `EGAnet`, `paran` are **not** in
DESCRIPTION (earlier design considered them; implementation chose leaner
routes). `future`/`future.apply`/`parallel` are **not** in Imports: M26
added `future.apply` + `future` to **Suggests** only (optional ESEM
parallelism), keeping the framework choice
(sequential/multisession/multicore) entirely in the user’s hands via
[`future::plan()`](https://future.futureverse.org/reference/plan.html) —
no `ncores` argument, no behaviour change by default. `EFAtools` (M12)
and `future.apply` (M26) are both gated behind
[`rlang::is_installed()`](https://rlang.r-lib.org/reference/is_installed.html)
— never hard-required.

Gate every Suggests use with
[`rlang::check_installed()`](https://rlang.r-lib.org/reference/is_installed.html)
and a helpful cli message naming the engine that needs it. **No Rcpp
dependency planned** (see §3).

## 13. Testing & infrastructure

- testthat 3e; snapshot tests of the **PCA path against
  [`psych::bassAckward()`](https://rdrr.io/pkg/psych/man/bassAckward.html)**
  on [`psych::bfi`](https://rdrr.io/pkg/psych/man/bfi.html) to prove
  numerical agreement on the original method.
- The §5.4 **algebra-vs-scores cross-check** as a standing test for
  every linear engine.
- Per-level **convergence handling** tested: a deliberately hard level
  must warn + skip, not error, and the result must still build to the
  deepest converged level.
- Sign-alignment and lineage-matching tested on a constructed case with
  a known multi-parent child.
- roxygen2 docs, pkgdown site, CI (`R CMD check`, lintr/styler), a
  reproduction vignette.

## 14. Decisions resolved & remaining

**Resolved (design round):** 1. Rotation → **varimax (orthogonal) across
all engines, hardcoded internal constant since M13**; oblique rotation
is **out of scope** (resolved 2026-06 — it confounds the cross-level
signal that is the method’s whole point). `rotation` removed as a user
argument in M13. 2. Correlation basis → **`pearson` default,
`polychoric` opt-in**, with an ordinal-detection cli **warning** (no
silent switching). 3. Within-level order → **primary-parent (recursive),
variance tiebreak**; `f{j}` IDs follow it. 4. Ordinal ESEM scoring →
**tenBerge on polychoric (linear → algebra)** as default; **EAP
opt-in**. Default Likert path does **not** need `data` at edge time. 5.
Package name → **`ackwards`** (verify via
`available::available("ackwards")`).

**Resolved during build (M1–M3):** 6. Ordinal-detection heuristic: **≤ 7
distinct integer values** triggers the warning. 7. CF `kappa`: **κ =
1/p** (varimax-equivalent; Crawford & Ferguson 1970). The `kappa`
argument was accepted and stored but never wired to any engine — all
engines hardcoded `cfT → "varimax"`. Removed entirely in M13: CF(κ=1/p)
≡ varimax; the literature never varies kappa; exposing it implied
quartimax/equamax were reasonable alternatives (they are not for this
method). 8. `cor = "spearman"` added alongside `"pearson"` as a
non-polychoric rank-based option. 9. `fm` argument exposed for EFA
engine (`"minres"` default, `"ml"`, `"pa"`). 10. `cut_show` argument
exposed (default 0.3) to control which edges are flagged `above_cut`.

**Resolved for M4:** 11. ESEM engine →
**[`lavaan::efa()`](https://rdrr.io/pkg/lavaan/man/efa.html)**
(EFA-in-SEM, not full ESEM with structural paths). Gives per-level fit
indices + rotation-aware SEs + WLSMV ordinal estimation. Does **not**
require full ESEM block syntax; the bass-ackwards levels are independent
EFA solutions. 12. ESEM scoring → self-compute tenBerge weights from
lavaan’s estimated loadings `Λ` and latent correlation matrix `R` via
the existing `.tenBerge_weights(R, Λ)`. `lavPredict()` is not used for
the default path (it lacks tenBerge); it is the eventual hook for EAP
opt-in. 13. EAP scoring → **out of scope (declined M28).** EAP’s
shrinkage attenuates cross-level correlations — the primary signal
bass-ackwards measures — making it theoretically inferior to tenBerge
for this method. An EAP request still returns
`cli_abort("not yet implemented")`. The scores-route seam in
[`compute_edges()`](https://jmgirard.github.io/ackwards/reference/compute_edges.md)
is preserved, but implementing EAP is not planned. 14.
`cor = "polychoric"` → **general basis** for all engines (not
ESEM-only). PCA/EFA compute `R` via
[`psych::polychoric()`](https://rdrr.io/pkg/psych/man/tetrachor.html) in
[`ackwards()`](https://jmgirard.github.io/ackwards/reference/ackwards.md)
then feed it to the engine as usual. ESEM uses lavaan’s own latent
correlation matrix as `R` for edges (do not mix psych-polychoric `R`
with lavaan-WLSMV loadings). 15. ESEM ordinal estimator → **WLSMV**
default; ULSMV a documented option. 16. `loadings_se` → added to the §4
level contract (p×k matrix, NULL for PCA/EFA).

**Completed in M4 (in addition to items 11–16 above):** - NPD polychoric
matrices: warn + smooth via
[`psych::cor.smooth()`](https://rdrr.io/pkg/psych/man/cor.smooth.html)
(implemented). - Convergence truncation tested for the ESEM engine (k=4+
on p=6 triggers lavaan error → warn + truncate → object builds to
k_eff=3). - Algebra-vs-scores cross-check documented as
Pearson/continuous paths only; polychoric ESEM edges (algebra uses
lavaan polychoric R; scores route uses Pearson standardization) diverge
by design and are excluded from the oracle.

**Resolved for M5 (Forbes extension):** 17. API → ~~two orthogonal args:
`pairs = c("adjacent","all")` and
`prune = c("none","redundant","artefact")` (char vector; default
`"none"`). `prune != "none"` auto-upgrades `pairs` to `"all"` with a
loud `cli_inform()` (chains need all-levels edges to assess).~~
**Superseded by M34** (item 27 below): pruning is now a standalone
[`prune()`](https://jmgirard.github.io/ackwards/reference/prune.md)
verb, not an
[`ackwards()`](https://jmgirard.github.io/ackwards/reference/ackwards.md)
argument, and `pairs` no longer auto-upgrades. 18. Prune action →
**flag-only, never remove.** Adds `pruned`/`prune_reason` annotation
columns to the edge/node tidy structures; the object retains all levels
(preserves Invariant 5 and the algebra-vs-scores oracle). Pruning is
interpretive relabeling, **not** re-estimation — say so in `print`/docs
(extends the §2 honesty caveat). 19. Redundancy → faithful to Forbes
(2023): score-correlation chains `|r| ≥ .9` (default, tunable),
retention rule = keep the bottom node if the chain reaches level k
(most-specific, best-defined), else keep the topmost node (broadest
manifestation). Tucker’s φ (`> .95`, Lorenzo-Seva & ten Berge 2006)
computed on aligned loadings as an **optional conjunctive** criterion. φ
formula `Σaᵢbᵢ / sqrt(Σaᵢ² · Σbᵢ²)`; base R, no new dependency. 20.
**Additive enrichments over the paper** (default output still matches
Forbes’s examples): always *report* both `r` and `φ` for every
redundancy candidate (report-first, flag-second — borderline cases like
the paper’s own `.89`/`.93` alcohol component stay visible); report
endpoint `r` (direct, from all-levels edges) alongside the chain and
flag where they disagree (correlation is non-transitive: a clean
adjacent chain neither implies nor is implied by endpoint identity — the
chain answers “perpetuates at every level,” endpoint `r` answers “same
construct”). 21. Artifact → **never auto-flagged.**
`prune(x, "artifact")` surfaces φ for inspection; removal is a
documented researcher judgment (Forbes is explicit this introduces
researcher DoF / confirmation bias; cf. Wicherts et al. 2016).

**Resolved for M32 (API-shape & naming; owner-reviewed, no equivalent
guidance elsewhere in this document):** 22. `tidy(x, what = "fit")`
long-format key column → **`statistic`**, replacing `index` (which read
as a row position; it actually held fit-index names for EFA/ESEM and
eigenvalue positions for PCA). Wide format (`format = "wide"`)
unaffected — column names still come from the values of this key. 23.
`k_max` naming collision
([`ackwards()`](https://jmgirard.github.io/ackwards/reference/ackwards.md)
= extraction depth
vs. [`suggest_k()`](https://jmgirard.github.io/ackwards/reference/suggest_k.md)
= max factors/components evaluated) → **keep the shared name in both
functions.** They’re genuinely the same dial applied at different
workflow stages (`suggest_k(k_max = ...)` → `ackwards(k_max = ...)`);
renaming one would create vocabulary drift without removing any real
ambiguity. Resolved instead via roxygen: each function’s `@param k_max`
states its own meaning and cross-references the other’s. 24.
`tidy(what = "fit")` cutoff flags → **removed.** The `cutoffs = TRUE`
argument and the `meets`/`{statistic}_meets` columns it produced
(`.flag_fit()`) are dropped; a pass/fail boolean quietly endorsed Hu &
Bentler (1999) thresholds that the package elsewhere (§9, this section)
treats as conventional and contested — continuing the M28/M31
output-honesty trajectory. `.fit_cutoffs()` is retained as an internal
helper: `autoplot(what = "fit")` still draws threshold reference lines
and [`summary()`](https://rdrr.io/r/base/summary.html) still annotates
inline with a check/cross mark: both are visual guides, not a returned
pass/fail column a user could mistake for a computed judgment. 25.
Variance scale → **proportion, 0-1** (`tidy(what = "variance")` columns
renamed `variance_pct`/`cumulative_pct` → `proportion`/`cumulative`,
values divided by 100). This aligns
[`tidy()`](https://generics.r-lib.org/reference/tidy.html) with the
engine’s internal `variance` slot (already 0-1; see `print.ackwards`,
which reads it directly) and with broom/psych convention (`psych`
reports “Proportion Var” as 0-1). Percent formatting moves to the
display layer ([`print()`](https://rdrr.io/r/base/print.html),
[`summary()`](https://rdrr.io/r/base/summary.html), vignette `gt`
tables) rather than living in the tidy data. 26. **M31-deferred:
effective ESEM estimator recorded in `$meta`.** M31 explicitly deferred
this (“better bundled with M32’s meta/column decisions than bolted on
here”): `x$meta$estimator` now stores the effective estimator after
auto-selection (`"ML"`/`"MLR"`/`"WLSMV"`/`"ULSMV"`; `NA` for PCA/EFA).
[`summary()`](https://rdrr.io/r/base/summary.html) gains a one-line
footnote naming lavaan’s scaled-variant reporting (§14.M31 point
2/Post-review) whenever the effective estimator is
`"WLSMV"`/`"ULSMV"`/`"MLR"` — not shown for `"ML"`, which has no scaled
variant.

All five M32 changes are breaking with no deprecation path (pre-CRAN, no
users; consistent with the M34 pruning-verb precedent of clean moves
over compatibility shims).

**Resolved for M34 (pruning verb; owner-reviewed, breaking, no
deprecation path — pre-CRAN, no users):** 27. Pruning extracted into a
standalone, pipeable S3 generic
[`prune()`](https://jmgirard.github.io/ackwards/reference/prune.md)
(`prune.ackwards`), not an
[`ackwards()`](https://jmgirard.github.io/ackwards/reference/ackwards.md)
argument. The five prune-related args (`prune` → renamed `rules`,
`redundancy_r`, `redundancy_phi`, `min_items`, `orphan_r`) leave
[`ackwards()`](https://jmgirard.github.io/ackwards/reference/ackwards.md)
entirely: `ackwards(...) |> prune(...)`. Rationale: extraction is the
expensive, deterministic step; pruning is cheap and interpretive.
Separating them lets a researcher re-prune with new thresholds without
re-extracting (re-running ESEM per level is the expensive path M26
optimized).
[`prune()`](https://jmgirard.github.io/ackwards/reference/prune.md) is a
generic (`UseMethod`), not a plain function, so it coexists with the
`prune` generics already defined by recursive-partitioning packages
(e.g. [`rpart::prune`](https://rdrr.io/pkg/rpart/man/prune.rpart.html))
regardless of package load order. Returns the same `ackwards` object
with `$prune` populated (replacing any prior pruning) — no new class, so
`print`/`summary`/`tidy`/`glance`/`augment`/ `autoplot` all work
unchanged. 28. Edges for redundancy chains and artifact φ are recomputed
**fresh inside
[`prune()`](https://jmgirard.github.io/ackwards/reference/prune.md)**
via `compute_edges(pairs = "all")` from the object’s stored `levels`/`r`
(Invariant 3), and never written back to `x$edges` (Invariant 1: one
edge path).
[`ackwards()`](https://jmgirard.github.io/ackwards/reference/ackwards.md)‘s
`pairs` auto-upgrade to `"all"` when pruning was requested (M5 item 17)
is removed along with it — `pairs` is now a pure display/storage setting
on
[`ackwards()`](https://jmgirard.github.io/ackwards/reference/ackwards.md),
decoupled from pruning;
[`prune()`](https://jmgirard.github.io/ackwards/reference/prune.md)
works correctly regardless of the fit-time `pairs` value. 29. Manual
pruning: `prune(x, rules = "none", manual = c("m4f3", "m4f4"))` flags
user-named nodes directly (standalone, no auto rule needed), or unions
them onto an auto rule’s flags
(`prune(x, "redundant", manual = c(...))`). Unknown labels error. On
overlap between an auto rule and `manual`, the auto rule’s
`prune_reason` wins (more informative); only otherwise-unflagged manual
nodes get `prune_reason = "manual"`. 30. Naming: canonical rule name is
**`"artifact"`** (US spelling, the owner’s preference), with
`"artefact"` accepted as an alias (nod to Commonwealth spelling and to
Forbes’ own usage) and normalized internally to `"artifact"`. Existing
code passing `"artefact"` keeps working. `"tucker"` was considered and
rejected as an alias/rename: the mode surfaces more than Tucker’s φ (it
also computes the `few_items`/`orphan`/`split_merge` structural
signals), so naming it after the statistic would mislabel the umbrella —
`"artifact"` names what the mode is *for*. 31.
[`ackwards()`](https://jmgirard.github.io/ackwards/reference/ackwards.md)
explicitly rejects the five removed args if passed via `...` (rather
than silently absorbing them) with a pointer to
[`prune()`](https://jmgirard.github.io/ackwards/reference/prune.md) —
silent absorption would be a masked-argument footgun, not the clean
break intended (Invariant 6: loud, not silent).

**Known limitations / deferred to future milestones:** - `factor_cor` in
the ESEM engine is not permuted by the variance-sort `ord` vector. Safe
permanently: only orthogonal rotation is supported (`factor_cor = I`;
permutation of I is I), and oblique rotation is out of scope (§9,
§14.1). The guard comment in `engine_esem.R` documents what *would* be
required if that decision were ever reversed. - Algebra-vs-scores
cross-check does not cover `cor = "polychoric"` paths (see above). -
`cor = "spearman"` + `engine = "esem"` is semantically inconsistent
(lavaan fits Pearson ML on raw data while edges use Spearman R); a
warning is now emitted (M10). - ~~ESEM engine does not detect or warn on
improper/Heywood solutions~~ — **resolved M10**: engine now inspects
`lavaan::lavInspect(fit, "theta")` and warns when
`any(diag(theta) <= 0)` (parity with EFA engine, Invariant 7). - **ESEM
ML/MLR with `missing = "pairwise"`**: lavaan uses listwise deletion for
the model fit while edges are computed from a separately-computed
pairwise [`stats::cor()`](https://rdrr.io/r/stats/cor.html) — a minor
inconsistency (fit statistics at complete-case N, edges at full pairwise
N). Documented in `$meta$missing`; a per-call advisory warning fires
whenever NAs are detected. Use `missing = "listwise"` or `"fiml"` to
resolve. *(Added M16; §9 `missing` row cross-references this.)* -
**Forbes-extension improvements deferred past M5** (the published method
has weaker spots worth strengthening later; M5 ships the faithful
method + the §14.20 reporting enrichments): - ~~*Structural artefact
signals.*~~ **Done M25 (Wave 2).** `prune = "artefact"` now populates
`x$prune$structural` with per-factor `few_items` / `orphan` /
`split_merge` signals (flag/report only; no auto-pruning). Args:
`min_items = 3L`, `orphan_r = 0.5`. `split_merge` is `TRUE` when a
factor’s primary items came from multiple different primary factors at
the preceding level. CLI and
[`print()`](https://rdrr.io/r/base/print.html)/[`summary()`](https://rdrr.io/r/base/summary.html)
report the flagged count. - ~~*Factor-score-indeterminacy caveat for
EFA/ESEM redundancy.*~~ **Done M25 (Wave 3).** `redundancy_phi = NULL`
now auto-resolves: PCA → no φ filter; EFA/ESEM → `0.95`. `NA` is the
explicit opt-out. Announces via cli when auto-applied (Invariant 6). See
§9 defaults table. - *Selection bias in the “strongest” edge.* Plotting
the max correlation across many all-levels pairs capitalizes on chance
(85 → 1,320 correlations as levels grow). Add bootstrap CIs / SEs on
edges (reuse the `loadings_se` infrastructure) so the strongest-edge
claim is inferentially honest. **Deferred; warrants its own milestone**
(perf-heavy: each resample re-runs full extraction at every level; needs
[future](https://future.futureverse.org) parallelisation +
print/plot/vignette integration).

## 15. Milestones

The milestone history is **no longer duplicated here** — it lives in a
single detailed log,
[`MILESTONES.md`](https://jmgirard.github.io/ackwards/MILESTONES.md),
with a one-line index in `CLAUDE.md`. This section was originally a
forward-looking roadmap; now that the roadmap is complete, keeping a
second copy of the log invited drift (see the git history around
2026-06-30). For what remains / is deferred, see §14 (Decisions
remaining) and `CLAUDE.md`’s “Out of scope” list.
