# M68: Re-verify the 3 collapsed synthesis pages against their member sources

- **Status:** review
- **Priority:** normal
- **Depends on:** M67
- **Branch:** `m68-reference-verification-collapsed-pages`
- **Principles touched:** IP8

## Goal

Read every standing fact on the three collapsed `cairn/references/` synthesis pages
back against the shelf PDFs of their 17 member sources, clearing the last of the
`references staleness` advisory.

## Scope

**In:** `rotation-and-k.md` (6 members: crawford1970, browne2001a, horn1965,
velicer1976, lim2019, achim2021), `applications.md` (6 members: kim2015, markon2005,
wright2014a, forbush2018, forbush2024, cowan2024), `background.md` (5 members:
kotov2017, schmid1957, yung1999, saucier1996, widiger2019). All 17 have shelf PDFs.
Same bar as M67 — standing facts only, corrections marked in place.

**Out:**
- The nine single-source pages → M67 (this milestone depends on it).
- Interpretive prose framing each collapsed set (the italic scope note, the
  "precedent for" clauses) — repo voice, not a source claim.
- User-facing propagation of any corrected fact → `/hotfix`, enumerated by T4.
- Splitting any collapsed page back into per-source notes. These pages were
  deliberately collapsed; if verification argues one member deserves its own page,
  that is a candidate row, not a scope grab.

## Acceptance criteria

- [ ] All three pages carry an extraction status naming a verification verb and its
      own `— observed YYYY-MM-DD`.
- [ ] `cairn_validate`'s `references staleness` advisory reaches 0.
- [ ] Every member entry's standing facts are checked against that member's shelf PDF;
      each page's work-log line names the members checked and any correction made.
- [ ] M61's already-verified `lim2019` / `achim2021` entries are absorbed by citation,
      not re-derived — including its finding that a vignette clause overclaimed
      `lim2019` (best among 13 PA *variants*, not all criteria).
- [ ] Each corrected fact is grepped across `R/`, `man/`, `vignettes/`, `NEWS.md`;
      any propagation is enumerated with `file:line` and routed to `/hotfix`.
- [ ] Docs-only — no files outside `cairn/` modified; `cairn_validate` all checks PASS.

## Coverage

- AC1 → T1, T2, T3
- AC2 → T5
- AC3 → T1, T2, T3
- AC4 → T1
- AC5 → T4
- AC6 → T5

## Tasks

- [x] T1: `rotation-and-k.md` — the varimax-default and k-advice supports; check the
      CF-varimax κ = 1/p claim, Horn's PA and Velicer's MAP descriptions, and absorb
      M61's verified DOIs for `lim2019` / `achim2021`.
- [x] T2: `applications.md` — six published-application entries; verify each citation's
      standing facts and the "precedent for" claims that name a specific finding.
- [x] T3: `background.md` — five framing entries; check the Schmid–Leiman and
      Yung et al. descriptions especially, since DESIGN cites them for what is
      deliberately out of scope, and the `saucier1996` "ruled out as comparability
      source" note against what that paper actually says.
- [x] T4: grep every corrected fact across `R/`, `man/`, `vignettes/`, `NEWS.md`;
      enumerate propagation with `file:line`; open `/hotfix` if any is user-facing.
- [x] T5: re-run `cairn_validate`; confirm staleness 0 and all checks PASS; commit.

## Work log

- 2026-07-19: created by /milestone-plan.
- 2026-07-19: status → in-progress; branch `m68-reference-verification-collapsed-pages` cut from master.
- 2026-07-19: T5 — `cairn_validate` all checks PASS, `references staleness` **0** (12 → 3 at M67 → 0 now); 80 dangling-id-token advisories are pre-existing and untouched by this diff. First run reported staleness 2: `Extraction:` must begin its own line for the parser to see it, and two pages had it mid-line after `per entry.` — fixed. Diff is `cairn/`-only (AC6). `Rscript tools/dod-gate.R` PASSED (check 0/0/0, coverage 100%, style/lint clean, pkgdown index complete); status → review.
- 2026-07-19: T4 propagation sweep — every corrected fact grepped across `R/`, `man/`, `vignettes/`, `NEWS.md`. Zero user-facing propagation, so no `/hotfix` is owed. One internal code comment is wrong (`R/engine_esem.R:5-6`, WLSMV attributed to forbush2024) — enumerated and dispositioned in Decisions. Confirmed clean: the intro vignette's `CF(κ = 1/p)` claim for kim2015 (exact, p. 1067) and `comparability()`'s citations (Everett 1983 / saucier1997 / saucier2005 — correctly not saucier1996).
- 2026-07-19: T3 `background.md` verified — **no corrections**; all five entries confirmed, including the two claims about goldberg2006 (p. 348's "received wisdom" quote and p. 356–357's "sequential" concession) and saucier1996's "ruled out as comparability source" negative (re-confirmed: "split"/"comparab" occur zero times in it). kotov2017's 40-author count verified exactly and its level definitions quoted from the paper. Sharpened saucier1996's `(.95–.84)` shorthand into the actual non-monotone series, and flagged its congruence correlations as not comparability coefficients. Noted kotov2017's shelf PDF is online-first (no journal pagination).
- 2026-07-19: T2 `applications.md` verified — kim2015 and forbush2018 accurate to the digit (kim2015 p. 1067 recorded as the verbatim source for DESIGN §9's orthogonal-rotation rationale and κ = 1/p); **three corrections** — markon2005's "goldberg2006 §5 singles it out" (Goldberg p. 356 names Saucier 1997; Markon is one of four "recent reports"), forbush2024's conflation of two results (92.4%/58.7% own variance vs the 0.88–334× / 1.95–80.8× comparisons, the low end below parity), cowan2024's "pure Goldberg recipe" (minres EFA + regression scores, not PCA + component scores). Added wright2014a's oblique geomin rotation and forbush2024's ULSMV estimator. One propagation found (`R/engine_esem.R:5-6`) — see Decisions.
- 2026-07-19: T1 `rotation-and-k.md` verified — crawford1970/browne2001a/horn1965/velicer1976 accurate (anchors added: CF Eq. 7 p. 323, orthomax equivalence pp. 324–326, Browne Table 1 p. 119 for κ = 1/p, MAP Eq. 9 p. 323); lim2019 abstract-verbatim, M61's variant-scoping absorbed as a ⚠ note; **achim2021 corrected** — the ~17% is the share of noise-factor simulations (16.8%, p. 70), not of "correct" retentions. Added crawford1970 p. 331's explicit varimax-when-k-unknown recommendation. Noted lim2019's shelf PDF is online-first (no journal pagination). No propagation into `R/`, `man/`, `vignettes/`, `NEWS.md`.

## Decisions

- **2026-07-19 (T2/T4) — one propagation found; not a hotfix.**
  `R/engine_esem.R:5-6` says ordinal data "uses WLSMV estimation (Kim & Eaton
  2015; **Forbush et al. 2024**)". Forbush et al. (2024, p. 633) used a
  mean-and-variance-adjusted **unweighted** least squares estimator (ULSMV),
  not WLSMV; kim2015 is the correct and only WLSMV precedent. **Disposition:**
  the line is an internal code comment — not rendered in any help page,
  vignette, or NEWS entry — so it is not user-visible and the hotfix bar
  (tracking-rules: "user-visible bug") is not met. It is also barred from this
  milestone by AC6 (docs-only, nothing outside `cairn/`). Routed as a
  **trivial** comment fix for a direct commit to master after this merge.
  The neighbouring `R/ackwards.R:14-15` varimax claim was checked and stands:
  forbush2024 used an orthogonal Crawford-Ferguson rotation, so "matches" is
  fair, though the paper does not state κ.
