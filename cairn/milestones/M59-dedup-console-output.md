# M59: De-duplicate console output & plot builders

- **Status:** in-progress
- **Priority:** normal
- **Depends on:** M58
- **Principles touched:** —   <!-- works under the cli-only-output and honesty-caveat conventions (D-001, D-008); numbers/strings preserved -->
- **Branch/PR:** m59-dedup-console-output

## Goal

Route `print`, `summary`, and `autoplot`'s repeated output blocks through shared helpers so every user-visible string, count, and glyph has one source of truth.

## Scope

**In:**
- Shared helpers for the blocks currently copied between `print.ackwards` and `print.summary_ackwards`: the engine/rotation/basis/n/k header (`print.R:20-28` ≡ `summary.R:53-61`), the load-bearing honesty-caveat footer (`print.R:139-147` ≡ `summary.R:248-256`), and the near-singularity caution (`print.R:77-83` ≈ `summary.R:169-177`).
- One prune-count digest read by **both** surfaces, replacing the two divergent extraction paths (`print.ackwards` reaching into `x$prune$…` inline at `print.R:86-126` vs `summary` routing through `.summary_prune` at `summary.R:196-236`/`304-334`) — the structural-signal count, phi-note, and redundant-node count are currently computed twice.
- `autoplot`: `.ba_add_nodes(p, nodes, …)` node-drawing helper + a shared theme finisher used by both the main path and `.ba_degenerate_plot` (`autoplot.R:553-567` ≡ `631-645`; `606-612` ≡ `654-660`).
- Consistency unifications (snapshot-captured): one convention for the 1-decimal cumulative-variance percent (`print` `round` vs `summary` `sprintf` — `print.R:49` vs `summary.R:78`); one convention for the tick/cross glyphs (`col_green(symbol$tick)` vs raw `✔` — `print.R:50` vs `summary.R:131`); route `autoplot`'s fit-caption threshold (`autoplot.R:794`) through `.format_r()` like the edge labels.
- Comment fixes in touched files: `summary.R:88` stale hardcoded line-ref → symbol reference; `summary.R:70` restating comment removed; one-line rationale added to `layout.R` `.spread_positions` (`:214-235`) and `autoplot` `dodge_x`.

**Out:**
- Core/engine and `ackwards()` dedup → "Remaining dedup pass" candidate.
- No rewording of user-visible content — strings are consolidated, not changed, except the two deliberate glyph/percent unifications, which snapshot tests capture.

## Acceptance criteria

- [ ] `print` and `summary` share one header helper, one honesty-caveat footer, one near-singularity caution, and one prune-count digest — no duplicated inline copies remain (grep-verifiable); existing `test-print.R` behavior preserved.
- [ ] Cumulative-variance percent and convergence/fit glyphs use a single convention across `print` + `summary`; `autoplot`'s fit-caption threshold routes through `.format_r()`.
- [ ] `autoplot`'s main and degenerate paths draw nodes and finish the theme via the shared `.ba_add_nodes()` helper + theme finisher.
- [ ] `print`/`summary` snapshot tests are green, with the two deliberate output unifications captured in reviewed, intentional snapshot updates.
- [ ] Comment fixes applied: `summary.R:88` stale ref → symbol; `summary.R:70` restating comment gone; rationale comments added to `.spread_positions` and `dodge_x`.
- [ ] `Rscript tools/dod-gate.R` clean.

## Coverage

- AC1 → T1, T2
- AC2 → T3
- AC3 → T4
- AC4 → T6
- AC5 → T5
- AC6 → T6

## Tasks

- [x] T1 — Extract `.print_ba_header()`, the honesty-caveat footer, and the near-singularity caution into shared helpers; route both `print` methods through them.
- [x] T2 — Build one prune-count digest (extend/reuse `.summary_prune`) and have both `print.ackwards` and `summary` read it; remove the duplicated structural-signal / phi-note / redundant-count inline code in `print.R`.
- [x] T3 — Unify the cumulative-variance percent format and the tick/cross glyphs across `print` + `summary`; route `autoplot`'s threshold through `.format_r()`.
- [ ] T4 — Extract `.ba_add_nodes()` + shared theme finisher; route both the main and `.ba_degenerate_plot` paths through them.
- [ ] T5 — Fold in the comment fixes (`summary.R:88`, `summary.R:70`, `.spread_positions`, `dodge_x`).
- [ ] T6 — Update/accept `print`/`summary` snapshots to lock the unified output; `Rscript tools/dod-gate.R` clean; commit with tracking.

## Work log

- 2026-07-12: created by /milestone-plan (bucket 2 of the 2026-07-12 codebase audit; sequenced after M58 to avoid utils.R churn overlap).
- 2026-07-12: set in-progress; branch m59-dedup-console-output.
- 2026-07-12: gate — glyph unification resolved to shared `.ok_glyph()` cli symbols, print keeps green/red, summary fit glyphs stay uncolored in grey line (user: "what do you recommend"). Percent → shared `.fmt_pct()` (sprintf 1-dp); prune digest → extend `.summary_prune` (renamed `.prune_digest`). No prior snapshot tests existed → establishing a snapshot net first (test-print-snapshot.R) to lock current output before refactor.
- 2026-07-12: T6(net) — snapshot safety net capturing current print/summary output (pca, efa fit-glyph line, pruning digest, near-singular caution) committed as baseline.
- 2026-07-12: T1 — `.print_ba_header()`, `.print_near_singular(min_eig, detail)`, `.print_honesty_footer(prune_note=NULL)` added to print.R; both surfaces routed through them. Near-singular `detail` and prune note wording differ per surface (≈, not ≡) so are passed in, preserving exact strings. Snapshots + test-print.R green (pure refactor).
- 2026-07-12: T2 — renamed `.summary_prune` → `.prune_digest`, moved to print.R shared helpers; `print.ackwards` now reads redundant/phi-note/structural counts from it instead of reaching into `x$prune$…` inline. Display wording stays per-surface. Snapshots + test-print.R green (pure refactor).
- 2026-07-12: T3 — added `.fmt_pct()` (sprintf 1-dp) + `.ok_glyph()` (cli::symbol tick/cross) to utils.R; print cum + summary cum/per-factor percent route through `.fmt_pct`; print convergence keeps green/red, summary fit-meets glyph now bare cli symbol (was raw ✔/✘). autoplot fit-caption threshold → `.format_r()`. Deliberate glyph change captured in accepted snapshot (✘→✖/x); percent convention locked by new `.fmt_pct` unit test (no snapshot diff on chosen data). New `.fmt_pct`/`.ok_glyph` unit tests. No new deps (dropped a withr reach).
