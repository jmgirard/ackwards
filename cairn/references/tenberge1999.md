## Why this is a primary source

The paper behind ackwards' **default scoring method** (`method = "tenBerge"`,
DESIGN §9): it defines the class of **linear correlation-preserving (LCP)**
factor-score predictors and gives the closed-form solution that
`psych::factor.scores(method = "tenBerge")` (and our own
`.tenBerge_weights(R, Λ)` for the ESEM engine) implements.

## The result

LCP predictors are linear predictors `f̂ = A'x` constrained to reproduce the
factor correlation matrix: `E(f̂f̂') = E(ff') = Φ` — equivalently
`A = Σ^{-1/2} C Φ^{1/2}` for some columnwise-orthonormal `C` (their Eq. 3).
Three historical LCP methods differ only in the loss they minimize:

| Method | Loss | Solution |
|---|---|---|
| Anderson–Rubin (1956) / McDonald (1981) | trace of variable-residual covariance | SVD of `Σ^{1/2}Ψ^{-1}ΛΦ^{1/2}` (Eq. 5); undefined when `Ψ` singular |
| Green (1969) | trace of factor MSE matrix | SVD of `Σ^{-1/2}ΛΦ^{3/2}` (Eq. 7) |
| Krijnen, Wansbeek, & ten Berge (1996) | determinant of factor MSE | closed form `C_d = Σ^{-1/2}L(L'Σ^{-1}L)^{-1/2}`, `L = ΛΦ^{1/2}` (Eq. 9, Thm 1 — the paper's contribution; previously iterative) |

Equivalences proved: determinant solution = McDonald's whenever `Ψ` is
nonsingular (Thm 2), and = Green's when `Φ` commutes with `Λ'Σ^{-1}Λ` —
in particular whenever the factors are **orthogonal** (Thm 3 + Cor. 1). So
**with orthogonal factors, all LCP methods coincide**; there is effectively
one "tenBerge" score.

## Relation to our implementation

- **Why it's the default** (DESIGN §9; DECISIONS D-007): correlation preservation is *the*
  property bass-ackwards cares about — edges are correlations among scores,
  and LCP scores reproduce the within-level factor correlation structure
  exactly instead of shrinking it (regression scores) or distorting it
  (Bartlett under some `Ψ`). Linear → algebra-eligible (Invariant 1).
- **Varimax default ⇒ orthogonal factors ⇒ the coincidence case (Thm 3)** —
  the method's behavior is unambiguous in our default configuration.
- Even correlation-preserving scores are still *predictions*, not the factors
  (indeterminacy) — the reason `redundancy_phi` auto-resolves to a φ guard for
  EFA/ESEM but not PCA (DESIGN §9 `redundancy_phi` row, M25/M43 wording), and a companion caveat
  to [[waller2007]] §4.
- ESEM engine computes tenBerge weights itself from lavaan's `Λ` and latent
  `R` (`.tenBerge_weights`), since `lavPredict()` lacks the method (DECISIONS
  D-016).
